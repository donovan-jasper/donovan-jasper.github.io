<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">From Songs of Travel by Vaughan Williams</span>

## Introduction

I sang piece this for Stanford Vocal Department Juries in the Spring 2024 quarter.

"The Roadside Fire" is a song from Vaughan Williams' *Songs of Travel* which sets poems by Robert Louis Stevenson to music. This song captures the spirit of adventure and the longing for a place to call home with vivid imagery of nature and the open road. The lyrics express a romantic and idealistic vision of building a life together with a loved one, creating a sense of warmth and intimacy. The roadside fire symbolizes the comfort and companionship found in the journey of life.

    <td>I will make you brooches and toys for your delight<br>Of bird-song at morning and star-shine at night.<br>I will make a palace fit for you and me,<br>Of green days in forests and blue days at sea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make my kitchen, and you shall keep<br>Your room, where white flows the river, and bright blows the broom,<br>And you shall wash your linen and keep your body bright<br>In rainfall at morning and dewfall at night.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>And this shall be for music when no one else is near,<br>The fine song for singing, the rare song to hear!<br>That only I remember, that only you admire,<br>Of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire.</td>
