<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">From The Princess and the Frog</span>

## Introduction

The *Princess and the Frog* is set in 1920s New Orleans and follows Tiana—a determined young woman with dreams of opening her own restaurant. When she encounters Prince Naveen, who has been transformed into a frog by the scheming Dr. Facilier, a twist of fate occurs: in a mistaken kiss intended to break Naveen’s curse, Tiana is also turned into a frog. As she embarks on a journey through the mystical bayou to find a way to reverse the spell, Tiana learns about love, self-discovery, and the true price of ambition.

“Friends on the Other Side” is performed by Dr. Facilier, the film’s charismatic villain. In the song, Facilier uses dark voodoo magic and persuasive charm to lure Naveen into making a dangerous pact. The number not only establishes Facilier’s menacing presence but also sets the tone for the film’s themes of transformation and the perils of striking deals with sinister forces.

      Don't you disrespect me, little man!<br>
      Don't you derogate or deride!<br>
      You're in my world now, not your world<br>
      And I got friends on the other side<br>
      (He's got friends on the other side)<br>
      That's an echo, gentlemen<br>
      Just a little something we have here in Louisiana<br>
      A little parlor trick, don't worry<br>
      Sit down at my table<br>
      Put your minds at ease<br>
      If you relax, it will enable me<br>
      To do anything I please<br>
      I can read your future<br>
      I can change it 'round some, too<br>
      I'll look deep into your heart and soul<br>
      You do have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?<br>
      Make your wildest dreams come true!<br>
      I got voodoo, I got hoodoo<br>
      I got things I ain't even tried<br>
      And I got friends on the other side<br>
      (He's got friends on the other side)<br>
      The cards, the cards, the cards will tell<br>
      The past, the present, and the future as well<br>
      The cards, the cards, just take three<br>
      Take a little trip into your future with me<br>
      Now you, young man, are from across the sea<br>
      You come from two long lines of royalty<br>
      I'm a royal myself on my mother's side<br>
      Your lifestyle's high, but your funds are low<br>
      You need to marry a lil' honey whose daddy got dough<br>
      Mom and dad cut you off, huh, playboy?<br>
      Now y'all gotta get hitched, but hitchin' ties you down<br>
      You just wanna be free, hop from place to place<br>
      But freedom takes green<br>
      It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need<br>
      And when I looked into your future, it's the green that I see<br>
      On you, little man, I don't want to waste much time<br>
      You been pushed around all your life<br>
      You been pushed around by your mother and your sister and your brother<br>
      And if you was married, you'd be pushed around by your wife<br>
      But in your future, the you I see<br>
      Is exactly the man you always wanted to be<br>
      Shake my hand<br>
      Come on, boys<br>
      Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?<br>
      Yes<br>
      Are you ready?<br>
      (Are you ready?)<br>
      Are you ready?<br>
      Transformation Central<br>
      (Transformation Central)<br>
      Reformation Central<br>
      (Reformation Central)<br>
      Transmogrification Central<br>
      Can you feel it?<br>
      You're changin', you're changin', you're changin', all right<br>
      I hope you're satisfied<br>
      But if you ain't, don't blame me<br>
      You can blame my friends on the other side<br>
      (You got what you wanted)<br>
      (But you lost what you had)<br>
      Hush!
