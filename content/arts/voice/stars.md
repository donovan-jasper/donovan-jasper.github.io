<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">From Les Misérables by Claude-Michel Schönberg</span>

## Introduction

I performed this piece at the Winter 2023 Kathryne Jenning's (Stanford) Studio Recital. 

"Stars" is a song from the musical *Les Misérables* which was composed by Claude-Michel Schönberg. In this dramatic aria, the character Javert expresses his unwavering belief in justice and his determination to capture Jean Valjean, a fugitive. 

The song is a testament to Javert's rigid moral code and his belief that everyone must follow the law without exception. The imagery of the stars represents the order and constancy Javert sees in the universe, which he believes should be mirrored in human society. However, the song also highlights the harshness and potential injustice of the law, as Javert's relentless pursuit of Valjean ignores the possibility of redemption and mercy.

    <td>He knows his way in the dark<br>Mine is the way of the Lord<br>And those who follow the path of the righteous<br>Shall have their reward<br>And if they fall as Lucifer fell<br>The flame, the sword!</td>

    <td>Stars<br>In your multitudes<br>Scarce to be counted<br>Filling the darkness<br>With order and light<br>You are the sentinels<br>Silent and sure<br>Keeping watch in the night<br>Keeping watch in the night</td>

  <tr>
    <td>You know your place in the sky<br>You hold your course and your aim<br>And each in your season<br>Returns and returns<br>And is always the same<br>And if you fall as Lucifer fell<br>You fall in flame!</td>

    <td>And so it must be, for so it is written<br>On the doorway to paradise<br>That those who falter and those who fall<br>Must pay the price!</td>
