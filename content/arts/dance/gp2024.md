<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">From The Nutcracker </span>

In 2024, I performed the Grand Pas de Deux from *The Nutcracker* again when a friend of mine was injured, and I was called to step in. The skill of my dance partner, Madi Yeung, greatly contributed to making the performance a possibility. Joining during tech week was intense, but I had a blast. 

The Grand Pas de Deux is a highlight of *The Nutcracker*, showcasing a beautiful and technically challenging dance between the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier.
