<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">From The Nutcracker </span>

After a 4+ year hiatus from ballet, I returned to perform the Grand Pas de Deux from Tchaikovsky's *The Nutcracker* in 2023 with the Cardinal Ballet Company at Stanford. Dancing ballet again was an enjoyable experience, and I'd like to thank Emily Okabe for her trust and willingness as a partner.

The Grand Pas de Deux is a highlight of *The Nutcracker*, showcasing a beautiful and technically challenging dance between the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier.
